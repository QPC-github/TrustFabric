# Terminology

* **Application** : Application represents a computer program that interact over network and perform a set of designed functions.

    * <u>Applications vs Services</u> : Applications mostly allow interactive access with a human actor, but may also provide non-interactive actions and interactions with other services.  Jacob Jenkov provided a good guideline for differentiating applications and services [here](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/soa/services-applications.html).

    * <u>Note</u>: Although the term application and service are used interchangeably in this document, TrustFabric uses *Application* as a standard term.  

* **Operators** : Operators are applications build to automate actions of a human operator. Typical example includes a mysql operator, that may perform lifecycle management aspects of a mysql database, just like a DBA.


* **Jobs** : Jobs are applications that are invoked by a pre-defined schedule or events.
